Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard 🌌
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard – where we dive into the fascinating world of microbes that call our navels home! 🤿 This interactive dashboard is your portal to explore the diverse ecosystem thriving on our belly buttons.

Project Overview 🚀
In this assignment, we've crafted a dynamic dashboard that brings the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset to life. This dataset unveils the microbial wonders inhabiting human navels, revealing both common and rare species.

Getting Started 🏁
1. Clone the Repository

bash
